      <description>I’ve wanted to put a website together for awhile. I’ve never really made it a priority. I started thinking about it more when I came across Nick Strayer’s datadrivencv. My original idea was to host a more detailed version of my CV as a website. Since I can never do anything half way I decided to do a full website, blog included! So here we are. I’m not going to do a line for line “how I made my website” kind of post.</description>
