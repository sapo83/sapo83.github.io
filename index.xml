      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning Julia. It has been awhile since I taught myself a new language. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a combination of two things. 1) Working my way through Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. 2) I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to implement a random forest model using an abalone data set I downloaded for another project. Between these 2 methods, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few things. I&amp;rsquo;m going to work through a few basic ideas here.</description>

      <title>Back to the Basics - A Refresher on Basic Plot Types in R</title>

      <description>Recently, I was working through a small analysis for a collaboration &amp;amp; I had to google how to make a box plot in R. I used to do more data viz than I do now. I was a bit bummed to have forgotten some basic plot types so quickly. I thought I would use this post as a quick refresher on some basic plot types in ggplot2.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!</description>

      <description>Facets can be a great way to visualize your data. Sometimes it helps to look at what different combinations of data look like &amp;amp; what may be missing. I used the Superbowl commercials data set available in the #TidyTuesday github repo to introduce facets here. When visualizing multiple groups, facets can really help in making a figure with multiple panels all aligned nicely with a good-looking aesthetic.
I&amp;rsquo;m also trying something a bit new with this post.</description>

      <description>I’ve wanted to put a website together for awhile. I’ve never really made it a priority. I started thinking about it more when I came across Nick Strayer’s datadrivencv. My original idea was to host a more detailed version of my CV as a website. Since I can never do anything half way I decided to do a full website, blog included! So here we are. I’m not going to do a line for line “how I made my website” kind of post.</description>

      <title>A Modern Day Comparison of 3 Heat Map Packages - Part 3</title>

      <description>This is Part 3 in my series comparing different heat map packages. You can find Part 1 here &amp;amp; Part 2 here.
In this part, I’m going to look at ComplexHeatmap. I think I first came across ComplexHeatmap on Twitter. It looks to have some really great features. The clustering &amp;amp; annotation features alone look amazing!!! This seemed like the perfect excuse to play with it a bit.
We’re going to use the same data as before.</description>

      <description>We’re back to look at another heat map package! This is Part 2 of a 3 part series. You can find Part 1 here.
As someone who learned R using primarily the tidyverse, pheatmap had a bit of a learning curve. As a grad student, I was looking for an easier way to make a heat map with clustered data. I was trying to make heat maps for about 50 gene clusters in a programmatic way.</description>

      <description>I’m going to use some early data from the first week of #TidyTuesday to do a comparison of different methods for making a heat map. The three packages I’m going to compare are ggplot2, pheatmap, &amp;amp; ComplexHeatmap.
The first package I’m going to look at is ggplot2, an integral part of the tidyverse.** You can create a heat map in ggplot2 using geom_tile(). One of the pros of making any type of plot in ggplot2 is it plays well with other types of plots made in ggplot2.</description>
