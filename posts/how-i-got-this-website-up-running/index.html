        <p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to put a website together for awhile. I&rsquo;ve never really made it a priority. I started thinking about it more when I came across Nick Strayer&rsquo;s <a href="http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/">datadrivencv</a>. My original idea was to host a more detailed version of my CV as a website. Since I can never do anything half way I decided to do a full website, blog included! So here we are. I&rsquo;m not going to do a line for line &ldquo;how I made my website&rdquo; kind of post. There are already plenty of those. I&rsquo;m going to do a high level overview with some hints &amp; tips I picked up along the way.</p>
<p>Very first thing I did was go straight to the source: the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> book. This helped me get the basics started. I skimmed some parts &amp; then decided to dive right in because that&rsquo;s how I do it. You&rsquo;ll soon figure out I love to jump right in without reading the documentation. It&rsquo;s a particular quirk of mine. So let&rsquo;s get into it!</p>

<h3 id="pick-a-theme" class="anchor-link"><a href="#pick-a-theme">Pick a theme<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>You need to pick a Hugo theme. Those can be found <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">here</a>. I spent waaaaay too much on this. I want everything to be pretty so I tend to overthink aesthetic choices. I had an idea in my mind about the general style I wanted. There seem to be 2 basic designs: all one page that you can scroll through/link to different sections or each section is a separate page. I wanted the separate page style so that narrowed down my choices. From there, I knew I wanted something more on the minimalist side. I actually tried two or three other themes before I settled on the current one: <a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam">Call me Sam</a>.</p>
<p>I did not read any documentation for this theme (Are we noticing a trend?). Therefore, I had some issues with things not working &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59505588/sass-files-conversion-in-blogdown-sam-theme">This Stack Overflow question</a> answered a very specific question. I could have also avoided this issue if I had at least skimmed the readme. My suggestion is to read the Readme of the theme you&rsquo;ve chosen!</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve chosen a theme (and read the readme), start a new project in R &amp; run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">blogdown<span style="color:#f92672">::</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">new_site</span>(theme <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This will set up all you need for the website, uses the theme you&rsquo;ve selected, etc &amp; then previews it for you. From here, you can start tweaking your theme. I&rsquo;m not going to go into a ton of detail here. The most significant changes I made were changing the background color &amp; highlight color. I also messed around with the syntax highlighting in code chunks. I would experiment with all these changes before you add any actual content. I deleted the whole project &amp; restarted multiple times before I got to where I was ready to add my own content.</p>

<h3 id="adding-your-own-content" class="anchor-link"><a href="#adding-your-own-content">Adding your own content<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>This is where things get a bit messy. I tried a couple different ways to add new posts. I finally landed on using the &ldquo;New Post&rdquo; option in the &ldquo;Addins&rdquo; menu. A helpful tip I picked up along the way is that you can set a project level &ldquo;.Rprofile&rdquo;. You can use this to set defaults for each new post. This works better than my previous method of cutting &amp; pasting the YAML at the beginning of each file. The command below allows you to edit the &ldquo;.Rprofile&rdquo; file associated with your project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="color:#a6e22e">file.edit</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;~/.Rprofile&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve done is kind of bypass blogdown all together. I will fully admit I don&rsquo;t understand the internals of how Hugo &amp; blogdown work together. I did figure out that to get the syntax highlighting &amp; pages to render the way I wanted it made more sense to use *.Rmarkdown files. <a href="https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2020-05-25-changing-you-blogdown-workflow/">This blog post</a> started me down the road of using a bit more Hugo &amp; less blogdown. The general idea is I run <code>hugo server --disableFastRender</code> in the terminal. I edit my <code>index.Rmarkdown</code> file, knit it &amp; then I can see the changes on <code>http://localhost:1313/</code> in my browser. Once I&rsquo;ve made all the changes I want, I kill the Hugo server running &amp; then run <code>hugo</code> in the terminal to build the website.</p>

<h3 id="page-bundles" class="anchor-link"><a href="#page-bundles">Page bundles<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>There are different ways to organize everything. I recommend using page bundles. They use a specific structure where everything related to a post is in a single directory. I found this easier to understand than some of the other methos. My understanding is that page bundles are a relatively new feature. Alison Hill has a great post about page bundles <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/">here</a> if you want to dig more into it.</p>

<h3 id="push-to-github" class="anchor-link"><a href="#push-to-github">Push to Github<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Github to host this page for right now. This may change in the future but it works for right now. There are a ton of tutorials on how to get your web page up &amp; running so I won&rsquo;t go into it here. I will, however, point out that the only directory you need to push to Github is <code>/public</code>. That was not immediately clear to me.</p>
<p>Depending on how complex you want to make this, you could use Github issues as a way to keep track of ideas. I&rsquo;ve been doing that to keep the list of things I potentially want to do with this site all in one place. I&rsquo;ve also been using branches to add things to the website. This can be a great way to practice pull requests/branches/issues/etc. on Github if that&rsquo;s something that you need to work on!</p>

<h3 id="publications-page" class="anchor-link"><a href="#publications-page">Publications page<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight Nick Strayer&rsquo;s <a href="http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/">datadrivencv</a> R package. The basic premise is you keep your data in Google sheets &amp; pull from there to create your CV. I had originally tried to pull/wrangle the data for the Publications page from both Google Scholar &amp; using my ORCID. It just never seemed to work quite right! I finally decided to put all my publication data into a Google Sheet &amp; pull it from there, similar to Nick&rsquo;s package. Thanks for the idea, Nick!</p>
