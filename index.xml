      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to put a website together for awhile. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really made it a priority. I started thinking about it more when I came across Nick Strayer&amp;rsquo;s datadrivencv. My original idea was to host a more detailed version of my CV as a website. Since I can never do anything half way I decided to do a full website, blog included! So here we are. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do a line for line &amp;ldquo;how I made my website&amp;rdquo; kind of post.</description>

      <description>This is Part 3 in my series comparing different heat map packages. You can find Part 1 here &amp;amp; Part 2 here.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at ComplexHeatmap. I think I first came across ComplexHeatmap on Twitter. It looks to have some really great features. The clustering &amp;amp; annotation features alone look amazing!!! This seemed like the perfect excuse to play with it a bit.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the same data as before.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back to look at another heat map package! This is Part 2 of a 3 part series. You can find Part 1 here.
As someone who learned R using primarily the tidyverse, pheatmap had a bit of a learning curve. As a grad student, I was looking for an easier way to make a heat map with clustered data. I was trying to make heat maps for about 50 gene clusters in a programmatic way.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to use some early data from the first week of #TidyTuesday to do a comparison of different methods for making a heat map. The three packages I&amp;rsquo;m going to compare are ggplot2, pheatmap, &amp;amp; ComplexHeatmap.
The first package I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at is ggplot2, an integral part of the tidyverse.** You can create a heat map in ggplot2 using geom_tile(). One of the pros of making any type of plot in ggplot2 is it plays well with other types of plots made in ggplot2.</description>
